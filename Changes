      Much documentation has been added.  Various methods have been corrected
      to use a much stricter policy for determining whether or not a given
      method was called in OO or procedural style.  More in-depth discussion
      regarding this issue is covered in the new documentation.

      Method OOorNO::shave_opts() now uses UNIVERSAL::isa() rather than
      CORE::ref() to check for an array ref as it should have in the beginning.
